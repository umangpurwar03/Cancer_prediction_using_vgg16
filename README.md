# Cancer Prediction with VGG16

This repository presents an implementation for cancer prediction utilizing the VGG16 deep learning architecture. The project encompasses deployment scripts, a pre-trained model, and sample medical image datasets.

## Project Components

- `deployment.py`: Python script facilitating model deployment.
- `train.py`: Python script for training the VGG16 model on custom medical image datasets.
- `best_model_1.h5`: Pre-trained VGG16 model file.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample medical image datasets.

## Requirements

Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-prediction-VGG16.git
cd cancer-prediction-VGG16
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Train the Model:**

```bash
python train.py
```

2. **Deploy the Model:**

```bash
python deployment.py
```
